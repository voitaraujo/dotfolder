# INSTALL DOTFILES

```
./bootstrap.sh
``` 



## IMPORTANT!!!

- The `bootstrap.sh` assumes you've cloned the dotfolder repository to your $HOME directory and will symlink all the other files on the repo based on it.
- The script was made and tested only on (my)MacOS, keep that in mind if you want to use it on other Unix based systems.
- The script was made 90% by ChatGPT bc I dunno nothing about shell scripting, there might be some bugs.
